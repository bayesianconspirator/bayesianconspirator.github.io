## <a name="aboutme" id="aboutme"></a>About me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). I like to think about **the future** in general, very excited about intelligent assistance (IA) and Free and Open Source software currently. Specifically, I'm interested in their ability to massively reduce effort for people across broad real-world situations from academia with automated theorem provers, causal analysis to digitizing governance systems (mechanism design), public platforms and law to build knowledge from case law. Serious researchers in these fields summarize the curiousity and naiveness in my views as "cute", which inspired the name "bayesiankitten". 

I also love reading [mindblowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invented_tradition) [ethnographies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) which helps me develop [epistemic humility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_humility). I really hope there is a shift of focus from the excessive statistical analysis broadly popular in social sciences towards inclusion of detailed qualitative descriptions of situations in-field. I have the motto of ["Never underestimate the diversity of experiences people have"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/), and love trying to grapple with theories of social cognition, development of group norms and eventually culture. Well, contrarily I read a lot of [aspiring](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)-[rationalist](https://www.lesswrong.com/recommendations) and [pop](https://marginalrevolution.com/)-[economics](https://www.econtalk.org/) blogs with a sprinkle of [effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)-[altruist](https://www.alignmentforum.org/) and [pop-stat](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) blogrolls just because they are so damn cool! When I get tired of all the above awesomeness, I love going out for walks/hikes outside the concrete jungle -- capturing cool birds and animals (only in a camera)! 

One way to tell more about me is by categorizing myself into a bunch of probably-wrong categories, aka [fake frameworks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks): afterall ontologies make things more real. [My jungian personality type](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/) has consistently been INTJ, dominated by Ni and Te; or [my MTG Color Wheel](https://humanparts.medium.com/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d) results have been dominated by Blue and Red with a White tinge. The correlations might always be co-incidental as [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx) succinctly put, "A black cat crossing your path signifies that the animal is going somewhere". Politically, it's complicated: I am an [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism) in interpersonal interactions, communist at home, socialist democrat at local level and classical liberal at the national level. The main issues I deeply care about are: [Animal rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights), [decentralization of internet](https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb), [anti-copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_copyright), [slow-science](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bayesiankitten/bayesiankitten.github.io/master/images/slow-science-manifesto.pdf) or [libre culture](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Libre_Society_Manifesto), which you might notice are pretty niche, and none of the mainstream parties really care about.

When I was younger, I thought math was complex and elegant. To fellow youngsters -- ["If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/110157-if-people-do-not-believe-that-mathematics-is-simple-it). I want to dedicate my career towards designing principled algorithms to acquire more general notions of "learnability" and help enable people to  automate boring tasks (like proving tedious theorems) and also assist humans for other stuff. I work as a DPhil student exploring baby steps to these problems at the Torr Vision Group at University of Oxford.
