## <a name="aboutme" id="aboutme"></a>About me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). 

I really like writing, but often don’t do as much of it as I’d like.

If we are into categorization, here are a few. 

The category of a [socially anxious extrovert](https://jesswhittlestone.com/blog/2020/11/1/being-a-socially-anxious-extrovert) describes me perfectly -- I love to meet new people, hang and have fun but  around people 

Welcome to my blog, containing most of my more polished armchair theories and journalistic attempts. I also love meeting people face to face; I predict that if you enjoy this blog you will enjoy hanging out with me.


Here is a archive of [recent blogs I like]().

 This github username was created when in high school, as a battle against the impossible dream of being "Dr. Ameya" (pun intended) and motivation for it.

I like to think about **the future** in general, currently intrigued by intelligent assistance (IA) with applications in computational economics, automated theorem provers, innovations in social policy and constitutional law. I want to dedicate my career towards designing principled algorithms to acquire more general notions of "learnability" and help better automating tasks (like proving tedious theorems) and also assist humans for other stuff. Serious researchers think it's cute when I talk about theories of market matching, social cognition, mechanism design,  etc. I'm wayy too  excited by cool topics and their insights.
