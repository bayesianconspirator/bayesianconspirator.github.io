## <a name="aboutme" id="aboutme"></a>About me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). I like to think about **the future** in general, currently excited about intelligent assistance (IA) and it's ability to massively reduce effort for people across broad real-world situations from academia with automated theorem provers, decoupling confounders for causal analysis to digitizing governance systems with mechanism design, open-source public platforms and law to build knowledge from case law and speed up the more boring aspects. I Serious researchers in these fields summarize my views combining curiousity and naiveness as "cute", which inspired the "kitten" part of this blog's title. 

I also love reading [crazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invented_tradition) [ethnographies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) which helps me develop [epistemic humility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_humility). I have the motto of ["Never underestimate the diversity of experiences people have"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/), and love trying to grapple with theories of social cognition, development of group norms and eventually culture. Well, I do read a lot of [aspiring](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)-[rationalist](https://www.lesswrong.com/recommendations) and [pop](https://marginalrevolution.com/)-[economics](https://www.econtalk.org/) blogs with a sprinkle of [effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)-altruist and stat blogrolls. I love going out for hikes outside the concrete jungle, capturing cool birds and animals (in my camera)! 

One way to tell y'all about myself is categorizing myself, aka with fake frameworks: These ontologies make things seem real. My jungian personality type has consistently been INTJ, dominated by Ni and Te; or my MTG Color Wheel results have been dominated by Blue and Red with a White tinge. But the correlations might be co-incidental as Marx succinctly said, "A black cat crossing your path signifies that the animal is going somewhere". Politically, I am  off-the-spectrum, the primary issues I care deeply about are animal rights, digital privacy, slow science or free and open-source software and such. I really like writing, but often don’t do as much of it as I’d like. 

Well at some point I thought math was complex and elegant. Now I agree with Von Neumann's statement "If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is". I want to dedicate my career towards designing principled algorithms to acquire more general notions of "learnability" and help better automating tasks (like proving tedious theorems and also assist humans for other stuff. I work as a DPhil student exploring this problem at the Torr Vision Group, Oxford.
