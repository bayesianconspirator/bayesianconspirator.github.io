## <a name="aboutme" id="aboutme"></a>Things I like

Welcome to my blog, containing most of my more polished armchair theories and journalistic attempts.

I like the idea of [help me lists](https://bayesianconspirator.github.io/blog/help_me/)! A bunch of things I am currently experimenting in the [AFK](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/afk-meaning/) world are [interesting lifestyles](https://bayesianconspirator.github.io/blog/) and [hacking](https://bayesianconspirator.github.io/blog/).

Here is a note on [interesting websites](), [interesting blogs on topics]() and my current [political beliefs](https://bayesianconspirator.github.io/blog/political_beliefs/).
