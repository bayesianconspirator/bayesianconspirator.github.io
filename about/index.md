## <a name="aboutme" id="aboutme"></a>About me

Hi! I’m Ameya, and since you're reading this: a-may-yeah (as in __a__ book, __may__ I?, __yeah__ sure!). I like to think about  __the future__ in general, currently very excited about public interest technology: intelligent assistance (IA), mechanism design and FOSS culture currently. 

**Origins**: I believe Information and consequently technology are inherently [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)), and can be enablers of transformative change across broad real-world contexts from automated theorem provers to digitizing governance systems and automation in law. Serious researchers from these fields describe my naive but curious and excited mindset as "cute", which inspired the name "bayesiankitten"-- the embodiment of cuteness, subtly signalling my love for all animals and respect for the scientific thought, inspired by the bayesian conspiracy from my favourite fanfic [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.hpmor.com/). 

**Epistemic Interests**: I love reading startling stories mainly in anthropology and evolution of cultures, from meta-traditions like [invented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invented_tradition) [traditions](https://meaningness.com/invented-traditions-and-timeworn-futures) to evolution of conceptions like [debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) and [ideals of](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/) [governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_Communities). These topics have inspired many of principles I deeply hold like [never underestimate the diversity of experiences people have](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/02/different-worlds/). I love trying to grapple with hard problems of social cognition, development of group norms and eventually culture. Contrarily, I read a lot of dope [aspiring](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)-[rationalist](https://www.lesswrong.com/recommendations) and [pop](https://marginalrevolution.com/)-[economics](https://www.econtalk.org/) blogs with a sprinkle of [effective](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/)-[altruist](https://www.alignmentforum.org/) and [pop-stat](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) ones. I really hope there is a shift of focus from the excessive statistical analysis broadly popular in social sciences towards inclusion of detailed ethnographies to understand the phenomena in its richness.


**Hobbies & Categorization**: After a healthy dose of [epistemically humbling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_humility) content, I love going out for walks/hikes outside the concrete jungle -- capturing cool birds and animals (only in a camera). I love EDM music and everything around it: I am a huge fan of house, techno & trance music, I play a launchpad (Ableton MK2) and am learning to shuffle. One way to tell more about me is by categorizing myself into a bunch of (probably-wrong) categories, aka [fake frameworks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks): afterall ontologies make things more real. [My jungian personality type](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/) has consistently been ENTJ, dominated by Te and Ni; or [my MTG Color Wheel](https://humanparts.medium.com/the-mtg-color-wheel-c9700a7cf36d) results have been dominated by Blue and Red with a Black tinge. The correlations might always be co-incidental as [Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx) succinctly put, "A black cat crossing your path signifies that the animal is going somewhere". 

**Politics**: I have a weird political grounding that I like to promote- I am an [anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism) in interpersonal interactions, communist at home, socialist democrat at local level and classical liberal at the national level. The issues I deeply care about are: [animal rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights), [immigration reform](https://openborders.info/), [decentralization of internet](https://dci.mit.edu/decentralizedweb), [anti-copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_copyright), [slow-science](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bayesiankitten/bayesiankitten.github.io/master/images/slow-science-manifesto.pdf), large negative externalities (waste disposal, pollution, deforestration) or [libre culture](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Libre_Society_Manifesto), which you might notice none of the mainstream parties really care about. You may try to predict my views on stuff based on these labels, but you have been warned about fake frameworks being, well, fake!

**Ecorithms**: When I was younger, I thought math was complex and elegant. To fellow youngsters -- ["If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is"](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/110157-if-people-do-not-believe-that-mathematics-is-simple-it). I want to dedicate my career towards designing principled algorithms to acquire more general notions of "learnability" and help enable people to automate boring tasks (like proving tedious theorems). The motto is always to design for people not around them: It’s the generation of IA (Intelligent Assistance), not AI (Artificial Intelligence). I aspire to an the ideal of “theoretically grounded approaches should go hand-in-hand with challenging practical problems” in my research: Principled approaches can accelerate research compared to extensive hit-and-try approaches popular today. Conversely, it’s important to make real-world assumptions to model computationally hard problems and side-step worst-case complexity. I work as a DPhil student exploring baby steps to some hard problems at the Torr Vision Group at University of Oxford.
