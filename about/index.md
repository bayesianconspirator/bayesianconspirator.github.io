## <a name="aboutme" id="aboutme"></a>About Me

Welcome to my blog, containing most of my more polished armchair theories, or as I say: The internet’s finest blog. I would be very happy to get help from you for anything on my [help me]() list.


My core politics is "I don't know" for most macro-issues; most people seem far too confident in their political opinions. 
I however seem to apply a lot of [anarchistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yccBBzSHFAM) principles for my personal life.

A bunch of things I am currently experimenting with in the [AFK](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/afk-meaning/) world are [vegan life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism), [minimalism](https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/), and adventure sports.

The jungian personality type of bayesianconspirator is INTJ with a strong Te and Ni. This blog would discuss a lot of economics, philosophy, 
and optimization, which let you be warned: I am not qualified. For discussions which I am actually qualified to talk about, visit my [academic blog](https://drimpossible.github.io). For posts I will regret writing in 10 years, visit my [personal blog](https://anarchicorganizer.github.io).
