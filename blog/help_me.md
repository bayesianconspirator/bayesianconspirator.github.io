## What is this?
I believe most people around me want to help, are very good-hearted and amazing people. We just don't effectively ask for help. 
I realized the power of helpful people around me in a [reciprocity circle]() at overcomingbias meetup, NYC. 

In the spirit, I am creating this list as my sincere call for help on issues I am struggling with. I will be eternally grateful to you and
help you to the best of my abilities in reciprocation. Hopefully, we make the world a slightly better place for each other!
 
## Issues
 
 
 Needless to say, shoot me an email if you read this and find that I am very suitable to help you on anything, with a few things you are 
 surprisingly good at!
