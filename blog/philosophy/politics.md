[Epistemic Status: Relatively firm]

Politics has been a wierd topic to discuss for natural [mistake theorists](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/). I am surprised how quickly political conversations escalate with [mandatory obsessions](https://putanumonit.com/2018/11/07/mandatory-obsessions/), extensive [signaling to the ingroup](slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/) and sometimes self-righteous claims of [tolerance and progressivism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Arguments become soldiers. You lose the [pursuit of truth](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/deceive.pdf) once you know which side youâ€™re on. 

My view is typically "I don't know" for most macro-issues: They are usually hard problems, since information across large populace doesn't aggregate easily. Especially because [people](https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577), [institutions](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/) and [methodologies]((http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf)) [are](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)  [often](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/14/too-many-people-dare-call-it-conspiracy/) [themselves](https://nintil.com/2016/04/10/on-the-express-acceptance-and-rejection-of-beliefs/) [misleading](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/). My best case is to explore different perspectives, meet interesting people and [rule thinkers in, not out](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/). I have been largely influenced by G.A. Cohen, Noam Chomsky, Hayek, Habermas, D. Friedman among others. You can largely guess my political leanings and the issues I'm primarily excited by from this. I mostly will [plastic-man](https://putanumonit.com/2016/09/16/plastic-men/) most hot-button issues to continue our more interesting discussions, anyways. So, err, apologies in advance for when you discover that. You've been warned!
