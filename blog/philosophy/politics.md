[Epistemic Status: Relatively firm aspect but very common. My only excuse for writing this note is that somehow the message still hasn't sunk in.]

Politics has been a wierd topic for me to discuss. I am surprised how quickly political conversations go weird, with [mandatory obsessions](https://putanumonit.com/2018/11/07/mandatory-obsessions/), extensive [signaling to the ingroup](slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/) and sometimes self-righteous claims of [tolerance and progressivism](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). This has led me to believe politics is really the mind-killer. Arguments become soldiers. You lose the [pursuit of truth](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/deceive.pdf) once you know which side youâ€™re on.

My view is typically "I don't know" for most macro-issues. We all like to explore different perspectives, meet interesting people and [rule thinkers in, not out](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/). I have really liked the concept. Especially because [people](https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577), [institutions](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/) and [methodologies]((http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf)) [are](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)  [often](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/14/too-many-people-dare-call-it-conspiracy/) [themselves](https://nintil.com/2016/04/10/on-the-express-acceptance-and-rejection-of-beliefs/) [misleading](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/). 

If you are still reading this, I probably like your company and will [plastic-man](https://putanumonit.com/2016/09/16/plastic-men/) most hot-button issues to continue our more interesting discussions. So apologies in advance for when you discover that. I like testing out ideas proposed by people I meet and books I read to my personal life. I often spend time thinking about our future involving popular issues with internet, decentralized governance, automation and cognitive biases even if I am surprisingly incompetant about them. Take everything you read from here with a pinch of salt. You've been warned!

P.S: Links are not very refined. I shall keep updating them in near future.
