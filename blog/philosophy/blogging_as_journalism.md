### Why this page?

I feel that most people blog pointlessly. If I want to write about some issue, my first instinct is to search for articles/blogs written very elegantly already. This gives credit to cool work by deserving people and liberates us to write only when we have something novel and elegant: An interesting take, a simplified version of an existing article, analysis over several posts, etc. I like to refer to this as "academic journalism", for it's uncanny resemblence to academic research. [Here]() is my post on why "journalism", just in case you were wondering.
