Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk

We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.
 
 So, remember to avoid:

    name-calling
    ad hominem attacks
    Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
    knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that I find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing WILL be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated. Crocker's rules do not apply here, neither for me nor for anybody. Please email me at bayesianconspirator at mailfence dot com if you think you have valuable feeback where I submit myself to Crocker's rules.
