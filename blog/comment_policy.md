This is created because Disqus wanted a link, so here it is, if it's ever going to be needed in the future. I hope it is, but I doubt it. Anyways, so here goes a first draft. 

We may have heated discussions sometimes and that’s cool. It's topics that we deeply care about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to sustain, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people. So, as a general policy, please remember to avoid:

 * name-calling
 * ad hominem attacks
 * Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
 * Knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that I find to be hateful, inflammatory, annoying or harassing will probably be removed. It is reign of terror-esque afterall. [Crocker's rules](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Crocker%27s_rules) do not apply here. Please email me at bayesianconspirator at mailfence dot com or message me at facebook slash ameya52 for a personal discussion. I do submit myself to crocker's rules there, i.e. you may optimize your message for information, and not worry about whether your message will be offensive.
