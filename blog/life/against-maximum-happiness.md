### Signalling

Signalling theory has caught up a lot in my friend circles (minus the evo-psych angle thankfully). The core idea of signalling is this: Many of the aspects we want to know about each other are not directly observable. Hence, we must rely upon signals as indicators of these qualities. Qualities can be almost anything: If someone wants to build a reliable set of close friends, the process usually involves judging aspects of people like honesty (will you often lie?), cleverness (are you smart?), trustworthiness (will you be a loyal friend?) or politeness (will you often be rude?). 

Everything we communicate, usually the language we use and our actions are used to signal these qualities to others. Saying “Yes, I would like to help you with finishing that box of fries” can be a signal of hunger or of politeness along with tinge of frankness. We have instinctive defense mechanisms against deceptive signals too -- we can automagically distinguish fake smiles from real happy faces. But, signalling isn't as interesting in everyday interactions as it is across longer spans of time. Robin Hanson talks about Signalling going wrong in this book [The Elephant in the Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday-ebook/dp/B077GZT9Q1/) where he describes how politics is not about policy, medicine is not about health, laughter is not about jokes, food is not about nutrition, education is not about learning -- it's so full of signalling. The last one is better elaborated in Bryan Caplan's [The Case against Education](https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste/dp/0691174652). 

In this blog, I am particularly interested in the most deeply held desires we have -- and how signalling (or peer opinion) affects it. 

### Status, Money and Signalling

If you ask people questions like "What do you want to be when you grow up?", "If you could switch yourselves with anybody who would it be?" the answers are typically moviestars or supermodels with fame and glamour, prime ministers/presidents with power, CEOs for their immense wealth or scientists for their cool knowledge. Desires people have seep through these questions -- usually fame, money or some other form of status. So, people try to optimize for these.

Yet, moviestars, singers, supermodels are usually so uniformly unhappy in life -- constantly annoyed by paparazzi and their news reports, work pressure, reviews of critics that they do drugs to get by in record numbers. Majority of people who go into acting or modeling are utterly broke, regularly exploited by high-end party circuits to make money off of them while giving them little in return. Presidents of the USA and India both are so hated, I frankly respect Trump and Modi for keeping their mental sanity. CEOs are probably worse, often have to work 80 hours at top performance and handling high pressure situations. 

 If you think this was bad, the worst are probably academicians. It's so competitive that most good people often get adjunct-jobs which pay equal to a Barista at Starbucks without the insurance. As a DPhil student, now you why I am so driven to put my anthropology hat on and study ethnographies of models, gangsters and other well-studied winner-take-all economies. 

Now, people around me have optimized cheaply getting happiness from status and wealth. The trick in cheaply optimizing wealth is spending wisely as Jacob describes in [his blog](https://putanumonit.com/2016/05/11/shopping-for-happiness/). I've learnt well not to undervalue the happiness to be had from excellent products in cheap categories. A Chanel bag costs \$5,000 not because it’s 100 times better at being a bag than a $50 bag. But, its used by rich people as a medium to signal that they can buy these. For all the such categories, I buy cheap stuff-- t-shirts, jeans, watch, mobile, cologne because I've learnt that the price does not correlate to quality. On the flip side, I can consume conspicuously the highest quality things without worrying them being overpriced for other stuff. I buy the best soap, air freshner, kitchen paper, bedsheets, chocolate shake, computer, books and shampoo/conditioner.

### Happiness 

Now, some of my friends go further and claim-- why not directly optimize for happiness? 


Clearly, happiness seems to be the thing to optimize.


The pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of pain, happiness as a goal of life is a very problematic notion. If we learnt anything from pyschoanalysis it is that we humans are very creative in subotaging our pursuit of happiness. It's often caused by the inability of the person to confront the consquences of their actions or desires. Think about it-- in our daily lives, we pretend to desire things we do not really, no matter how much we try to spiritualize it. The worse thing is to optimize what we think we desire for a pleasurable survival. Neither are we just instruments of some higher cause, religious or political. Similarly, do not fall in love with your suffering, renunciation of pleasure can easily turn into pleasure of renunciation itself-- signalling in its purest form.
