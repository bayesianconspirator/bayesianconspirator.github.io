[Epistemic Status: Shouting off rooftops. My only excuse for writing this is that somehow the message still HASN’T SUNK IN.]

Politics has been a wierd topic for me to discuss. I'm surprised how quickly political conversations tend to uncover [mandatory obsessions](https://putanumonit.com/2018/11/07/mandatory-obsessions/). Everyone seems to be [signalling to their ingroup](slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/), claiming to be very [tolerant and progressive](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Politics is the mind-killer. Arguments become soldiers. In politics, you lose the [pursuit of truth](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/deceive.pdf) once you know which side you’re on.

My general view is really "I don't know" for most macro-issues. If you are reading this, I probably like your company. I will probably [plastic-man](https://putanumonit.com/2016/09/16/plastic-men/) most hot-button issues to continue our more interesting discussions. So apologies in advance when you discover that.  Also, if you like my approach, consider [ruling thinkers in, not out](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/). I like the concept.

Afterall it's not just [people](https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577), [institutions](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/) and [methodologies]((http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf)) [are](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)  [often](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/14/too-many-people-dare-call-it-conspiracy/) [themselves](https://nintil.com/2016/04/10/on-the-express-acceptance-and-rejection-of-beliefs/) [misleading](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/). Nobody is perfect and anyone trying would just be hopelessly average.

I like to test out interesting aspects of books I read (often political) to my personal life. I often spend time thinking about our future: Topics like internet freedom, decentralized governance and cognitive biases even if I am surprisingly incompetant about them. Take everything you read here with a pinch of salt. You've been warned!
