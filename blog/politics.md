Politics has been a wierd topic for me to discuss. Everyone seems to be talking about it and expects you to know whatever they are talking about, with whatever weird reasoning of "Surely, Ameya must know!"

I decided to make this post to enable people who are interested enough in knowing my views. A lot has been written by much more [eloquently](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3ELrPerFTSo75WnrH). My only excuse for writing this is that somehow the message still HASN’T SUNK IN.

I'm honestly surprised just how quickly political conversations tend to uncover [mandatory obsessions](https://putanumonit.com/2018/11/07/mandatory-obsessions/). Everyone usually is [signalling to their ingroup](slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/04/the-ideology-is-not-the-movement/), claiming to be very [tolerant and progressive](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/).

Politics is the mind-killer. Arguments become soldiers. You lose the pursuit of truth once you know which side you’re on. It's not just [people](https://medium.com/incerto/the-intellectual-yet-idiot-13211e2d0577), [institutions](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/23/ssc-gives-a-graduation-speech/) and [methodologies]((http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/abandon.pdf)) [are](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)  [often](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/01/14/too-many-people-dare-call-it-conspiracy/) [themselves](https://nintil.com/2016/04/10/on-the-express-acceptance-and-rejection-of-beliefs/) [misleading](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/).

If you are reading this, I probably like your company and our discussions too much to [plastic-man](https://putanumonit.com/2016/09/16/plastic-men/) most hot-button issues. Afterall as a principle, I like [ruling thinkers in, not out](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/26/rule-genius-in-not-out/).

I like to apply principles from different philosophies (often political) to my personal life. I care about some issues like internet freedom, decentralized governance, cognitive biases and machine learning and hence will often discuss them here even if I am surprisingly incompetant about them. Take everything you read here with a pinch of salt accordingly.
