## Install the drivers

  * Download NVIDIA Drivers [from here](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
      * Do not use apt-get install nvidia-* for drivers. 
      * Generally they are few cycles older than those on the website.
  * You will get a file named something like this `NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run`
  * Give it executable permission
      * `chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run`
  * Run with sudo
      * `sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-375.39.run`

### Possible issues:
   You might have to stop the X-server (the GUI) to install the drivers.

   Use the following command on Ubuntu

   `sudo service lightdm stop`


## Install CUDA
  
  * Download the latest CUDA drivers [from here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

    Download the 'runfile (local)'. This avoids issues of proxy while installing using network based debian file.
  * Use the following command to run the installer:

     * `sudo sh cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run`
     * It will also prompt to install OpenCL and NVIDIA-Samples. It is not required but recommended to install those.
     * If you install NVIDIA-Samples, use 1_Utilities/deviceQuery to check the GPU specs.
     * It will ask you if you want to make soft-link to /usr/local/cuda - say YES

## Install CuDNN
  
  * Download the latest CuDNN [from here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
  * Extract the tar file.
  * Copy all the files inside lib64/ to /usr/local/cuda/lib64/
  * Copy the file include/cudnn.h to /usr/local/cuda/include/
  * Some libraries will require LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH to point to this lib64 directory:
    * `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_lib64>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
    * `export LIBRARY_PATH=<path_to_lib64>:$LIBRARY_PATH`

## Install Tensorflow
  
   For stable release version:

   * sudo pip install --upgrade tensorflow_gpu

   For latest nightly release:

   * sudo pip install --upgrade <url>
   Get this <url> from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
